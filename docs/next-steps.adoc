The Xillio API can be used to retrieve metadata about entities and entity content stored in repositories.
With the steps above we have barely touched the surface of what the Xillio API can do for you.
Please read the https://docs.xill.io/#_overview[documentation] and do some more experiments in the sandbox.
Some other possible actions are:

- https://docs.xill.io/#api_content_get[Retrieve the contents of an entity]
- https://docs.xill.io/#api_content_update[Update the contents of an entity]
- https://docs.xill.io/#api_entity_create[Create a new entity and upload a document or image to the sandbox]

We also encourage you to use your own programming language and tool stack.

Like mentioned before, the sandbox does not allow you to use any connectors other than the preconfigured cloud storage.
If you are interested in trying out the https://api.xill.io/connectors[other connectors] or simply want to know more, please contact support@xill.io.
