The Xillio API can be used to retrieve metadata about entities and entity content stored in repositories.
With the steps above we have barely touched the surface of what the Xillio API can do for you.
Please read the https://docs.xill.io/#_overview[documentation] and do some more experiments in the sandbox.
Some other possible actions are:

- https://docs.xill.io/#api_content_get[Retrieve the contents of an entity]
- https://docs.xill.io/#api_content_update[Update the contents of an entity]
- https://docs.xill.io/#api_entity_create[Create a new entity and upload a document or image to the sandbox]

We also encourage you to use your own programming language and tool stack to do the calls above that we did on the command line using curl.
